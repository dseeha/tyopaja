#Create a new-branch
To create a new [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
use the command git checkout -b new-feature
This checks out a branch called new-feature based on main, and the -b flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
